# Fusion360

The need to learn software came from the want for customization. I learned, through some online courses as well as trial and error, how to more efficiently create models to fit a variety of purposes. My designs are always free and uploaded to thingiverse as well a printables for ease of access. If you'd like other formats of a model let me know and I will be happy to provide them to you.
