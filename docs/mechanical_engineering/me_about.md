# 3D Printing and Modeling  

## Why?
I got into 3D printing out of curiosity which quickly turned into somewhat of an obsession. I initially bought a Kobra Go that was on sale, unfortunately the performance was not what I expected. Instead of returning it I began modifying it and have ended up only keeping the frame. Making these modifications required some custom modeling, so I figured I should learn how to do that.

## Fusion360
This is my modeling program of choice. I started out learning on this software and have continued to improve since. Most personal-use models I are published on my [Printables](https://www.printables.com/@Gallapagos_451642) and [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/gallapagos/designs) profiles. I've also created models for work, the main goal being to increase efficiency and repeatability. This repeatability is especially useful for troubleshooting, should it arise.
