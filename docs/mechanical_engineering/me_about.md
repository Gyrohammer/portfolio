# 3D Printing and Modeling  

## Why?
I got into 3D printing out of curiosity which quickly turned into somewhat of an obsession. I initially bought a Kobra Go that was on sale, unfortunately the performance was not what I expected. Instead of returning it I began modifying it and have ended up only keeping the frame. Making these modifications required some custom modeling, so I figured I should learn how to do that.

## Fusion360
This is my modeling program of choice. I started out learning on this software and have continued to improve since. Every model I create I normally post onto my Printables and Thingiverse profile. I have made some models for work as well to help streamline processes and ensure repeatability when performing tasks. This repeatability is especially useful for future troubleshooting should it arise. 

## 3D Printing
This hobby quickly turned into an obsession as I have continued to upgrade my printer. The need to model custom parts drove my learning of F360 (Fusion360). Other modifications have led me to learn other software packages as well such as KiCad.
