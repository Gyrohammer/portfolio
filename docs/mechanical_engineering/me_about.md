# 3D Printing and Modeling  

## Why?
I got into 3D printing out of curiosity which quickly turned into somewhat of an obsession. I initially bought a Kobra Go that was on sale, unfortunately the performance was not what I expected. Instead of returning it I began modifying it and have ended up only keeping the frame. Making these modifications required some custom modeling, so I figured I should learn how to do that.

## Fusion360
This is my modeling program of choice. I started out learning on this software and have continued to improve since. Every model I create I normally post onto my Printables[LINK] and Thingiverse[LINK] profile. I have made some models for work as well to help streamline processes and ensure repeatability when performing tasks. This repeatability is especially useful for troubleshooting should it arise.
