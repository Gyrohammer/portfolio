# 3D Printing/Additive Manufacturing
I began 3D printing after I saw a printer on sale. I have since modified every part save for the frame, the project is being tracked under my [KGM repo](https://gyrohammer.github.io/KGM/){:target="_blank"}. Along my journey I have learned how to model efficiently in Fusion360 as well as design custom PCB's in KiCad. This journey has culminated in a fully custom IKEA Lack enclosure that I have designed and assembled myself. The model of the enclosure can be seen below in the 3D model viewer.

<!-- Show pictures of enclosure, PCB, printer etc. -->

At work I lobbied for us to obtain a printer for quick prototyping and rapid product development. My request was granted, and I now lead the rapid prototyping division. My work has been used in tooling for the clean room as well as some parts being used in final production units.
