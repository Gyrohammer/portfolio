# Automated Backups and Safety Systems 

This homelab project initially started out as a way for myself and my partner to keep our computers fully imaged. Bacups are made every day and kept for several months as images allowing for a simple network boot through Macrium Reflect, if need be. Not only are our personal computers backed up on prem, but also the photos from our phones are also backed up. This aids in the common, 3-2-1 backup plan for data redundancy.
