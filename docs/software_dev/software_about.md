# Software/Programming  

#### C/++
I intially began my programming journey in highschool where I elected to take a course teaching C/++. In this course we learned the basics of programming culiminating in a final project to showcase our skills.

#### Java
The next elective was java. This classs was similar to the previous, I definitely enjoyed it more though. Java would be a language that I would return to occasionaly for small things such as custom scripts or some web oriented uses.

#### Python
This is the language I am currently most familiar with. I use this frequently to create small programs and automations that help increase efficienct both at home and at work. I learned python through using it, meaning my formalities with the code are likely to be uncouth. That being said my documentation is up-to-date and properly vetted from seniors at work.
