# Software/Programming  

My degree in physics has allowed me to venture into some coding and programming experience. We mainly used MATLAB in class, but I found ways to implement programming in a few instances. One such instance was using LaTeX for homework assignments as well as projects. I've found it to be extremely useful when needed to convet complex calculations, vs writing them out by hand. I've also used programming at home for some light applications such as 3d printing, modifying firmware, etc. I would not call myself an expert, but I am capable. One of my more complete and important projects has to do with my work, where I created software via python that allows for a more efficient workflow to maximize productivity.
