# Python

I have never formally learned python, but through a need I found myself working with it. This need came from an efficiency standpoint as data was manually parsed through excel. I saw this as slow and inefficient, so I sought out a solution. 

### VBA
Initially a macro was created in VBA. This proved to be too slow for larger files, and didnt give me the functionality and customisability that I wished for. 

### Python Revision
I then went to python as it is often touted the 'all in one solution' of languages. Obviously use cases matter, I'm sure my data parsing could be faster in C but I am not as well versed in that as I now am in Python. My program utilizes matplotlib and tkinter to create a window for the quick analysis of unit data. Instead of taking 5min to analyze a file, with possible mistakes, this program reads the file the same way every time, outputting the exact specifications and numbers that we need to see. This is not only more efficient, but more repeatable and therefore can cut down on troubleshooting when it arises.
