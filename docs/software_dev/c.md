# C/++

I initially picked up C during highschool for an elective class. It isnt a language I am extremely fluent in, but it is one that I am familiar with. Some future projects may be written in C. One example would be the re-write of my data analysis program from work. 

<!-- Maybe dont include this as you dont *really* know C/C++ -->
