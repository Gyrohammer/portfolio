Normally the lead technician would make an educated guess as to which batches performed the best for a given unit. I was unhappy with that system and instead, using Power BI (PBI), analyzed our historical unit data to find and bin the batches.</p> <p>As a result we now know exactly how each batch should perform which aids in troubleshooting when a machine is out of spec. We can also now use the performance analysis to ensure that high priority units are given the best batches for the quickest turnaround time.</p>"},{"location":"data_analysis/to_analysis/","title":"Tiger Optics Analysis","text":"<p>This is the batch monitoring that is mentioned on the previous page.

I also have unifi systems on my network which are controlled by a docker container on the main server.

I started out learning on this software and have continued to improve since. Every model I create I normally post onto my Printables and Thingiverse profile.

Obviously use cases matter, I'm sure my data parsing could be faster in C but I am not as well versed in that as I now am in Python. My program utilizes matplotlib and tkinter to create a window for the quick analysis of unit data. Instead of taking 5min to analyze a file, with possible mistakes, this program reads the file the same way every time, outputting the exact specifications and numbers that we need to see.
