This method, while more consistent, was much less efficient with larger files (some files extend into the 200MB range). I attempted to optimize this macro to the best of my ability, but it was simply too slow for it to be useful.

This journey has culminated in a fully custom IKEA Lack enclosure that I have designed and assembled myself. The model of the enclosure can be seen below in the 3D model viewer.</p> <p>At work I lobbied for us to obtain a printer for quick prototyping and rapid product development.

In order to achieve the goals I set for myself in those projects, I pushed to learn how to make such boards. I have mainly learned through KiCAD and dabbled in EAGLE/Fusion360 PCB design, with most of my experience being with KiCAD. I've only needed to design two circuit boards, both breakouts, but the process has taught me a lot and will continue to be of use into the future.</p>"},{"location":"pcb_design/about.html#printer-pcb","title":"Printer PCB","text":"<p>My enclosure project required the use of a custom PCB as a type of breakout board. One of my goals for the printer was to have all connections encapsulated into one connector.

I installed a Comma3X (car autopilot) system into my new vehicle. During the summer months it can get quite hot here, hot enough where I enjoy putting a sun-shield up to keep my car somewhat cool. This system gets in the way, so how can I make something that is reliable and easy to remove? Magnets! </p> <p>This design is similar to another on the comma ai discord. This design by cloudj has some advantages such as being CNC machined out of aluminum, adding strength and endurance. Downsides to his production include a long wait time, and high cost at \\$130USD per mount. My project aims to make the design open source and cost less at around \\$70-80USD. Downsides to my design will likely be its long initial development time and less resilient material (plastic vs aluminum). Hopefully my lead times are lower being US-based vs Taiwan-based.</p> <p>This project is still in the developmental stages, you can find its progress on the CommaPOGO github. Documentation and a full write up will be posted here once the project is more complete.</p>"},{"location":"software_dev/c.html","title":"C/++","text":"<p>I initially picked up C during highschool for an elective class.

Obviously use cases matter, I'm sure my data parsing could be faster in C but I am not as well versed in that as I now am in Python. My program utilizes matplotlib and tkinter to create a window for the quick analysis of unit data. Instead of taking 5min to analyze a file, with possible mistakes, this program reads the file the same way every time, outputting the exact specifications and numbers that we need to see. This is not only more efficient, but more repeatable and therefore can cut down on troubleshooting when it arises.</p>"},{"location":"software_dev/software_about.html","title":"Software/Programming","text":"<p>My degree in physics has allowed me to venture into some coding and programming experience. We mainly used MATLAB in class, but I found ways to implement programming in a few instances. One such instance was using LaTeX for homework assignments as well as projects. I've found it to be extremely useful when needed to convet complex calculations, vs writing them out by hand. I've also used programming at home for some light applications such as 3d printing, modifying firmware, etc. I would not call myself an expert, but I am capable. One of my more complete and important projects has to do with my work, where I created software via python that allows for a more efficient workflow to maximize productivity.</p>"}]}
