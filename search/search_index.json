I created a macro to automatically plot, display, and analyze the data in a given workbook. This method, while more consistent, was much less efficient with larger files (some files extend into the 200MB range). I attempted to optimize this macro to the best of my ability, but it was simply too slow for it to be useful.

Obviously use cases matter, I'm sure my data parsing could be faster in C but I am not as well versed in that as I now am in Python. My program utilizes matplotlib and tkinter to create a window for the quick analysis of unit data. Instead of taking 5min to analyze a file, with possible mistakes, this program reads the file the same way every time, outputting the exact specifications and numbers that we need to see. This is not only more efficient, but more repeatable and therefore can cut down on troubleshooting when it arises.</p>"},{"location":"software_dev/software_about.html","title":"Software/Programming","text":"<p>My degree in physics has allowed me to venture into some coding and programming experience. We mainly used MATLAB in class, but I found ways to implement programming in a few instances. One such instance was using LaTeX for homework assignments as well as projects. I've found it to be extremely useful when needed to convet complex calculations, vs writing them out by hand. I've also used programming at home for some light applications such as 3d printing, modifying firmware, etc. I would not call myself an expert, but I am capable. One of my more complete and important projects has to do with my work, where I created software via python that allows for a more efficient workflow to maximize productivity.</p>"}]}
